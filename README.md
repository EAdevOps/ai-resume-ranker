# ai-resume-ranker
AI Resume Ranker is an ATS-inspired app that scores a resume against a job description and explains why. It combines a transparent, deterministic rubric (skills, coverage, experience, education/certs, soft skills) with semantic similarity (TF-IDF) to produce an overall 0â€“100 score, five subscores, missing keywords, and actionable suggestions.
